# Quave Code Challenge

Do you want to join quave as a developer? Great. Read this document and then submit your solution. Good luck.

## Machine setup

- [Instalal Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is the best way to install Node.js
- [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install)

If you are new to Meteor we recommend this [tutorial](https://react-tutorial.meteor.com) for you to get familiar with it.

## Challenge setup

### Repository setup & process

- This git repository needs to be used as your initial state.
- Once completed remember to git push your changes.
- This challenge should only be submitted via a GitHub Classroom assignment (read more below).

### How to install dependencies

```bash
meteor npm install
```

### How to run

```bash
meteor npm start
```

### How to run tests

```bash
meteor npm run cypress
```

## What you need to deliver

A mini-application that allows event hosts to check people into an event.

The home page should show:

- an event selector (`select`) displaying the name of each event, by default displaying `Select an event` (communities collection);
- a list of people registered in the selected event (people collection).

The list of people should allow the event host to:

- see first and last name together (full name), company name, title, check-in date, and check-out date both using `MM/DD/YYYY, HH:mm` format or `N/A`;
- check people into the event by clicking the "Check-in {person firstName and lastName}" button;
- if the user was checked-in over five seconds ago, we want to see a "Check-out {person firstName and lastName}" check-out button.

Between the event selector and the list of people we want to see a summary like this:

- `People in the event right now: 10`;
- `People by company in the event right now: Green Group (10), Hoppe Group (5)`;
- `People not checked-in: 200`;

The page needs to be reactive -- no refresh should be needed to display the latest data.

## Implementation rules

- You must explain your ideas as comments in the code, we want to see how you express yourself in written English;
- You must use Meteor as the builder and runner, React as the view layer and MongoDB as the data layer;
- You must use MongoDB embedded in Meteor, don't configure the project to access a different MongoDB URL;
- You must not insert new documents into communities nor into the people collection;
- You must not change `initial-data.js`;
- You can add new dependencies;
- You can style the application.

## Important

- An automatic process will check your solution -- please follow the requirements as close as possible. Only submissions that pass the tests will be considered;
- We are not going to answer any questions about this challenge, so that all submissions can be fairly compared.
